IEC 62304 Compliance
====================

PulseEngine can target IEC 62304 (Medical Device Software Lifecycle Processes)
for medical device applications where the toolchain compiles safety-critical
software.

Software Safety Classification
-------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Class
     - Hazard
     - Required Activities
   * - Class A
     - No injury possible
     - Planning, requirements, release, maintenance
   * - Class B
     - Non-serious injury
     - + Architecture, integration testing, system testing
   * - Class C
     - Serious injury/death
     - + Detailed design, unit verification, full risk management

SOUP Management (§8.1.2)
--------------------------

IEC 62304 requires tracking of all Software of Unknown Provenance:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - SOUP Item
     - Version
     - Safety Relevance
     - Known Anomalies
   * - wasmparser
     - 0.241 (loom) / 0.219 (synth, meld)
     - Yes: parsing affects correctness
     - Version drift across repos
   * - z3
     - 0.19
     - Yes: verification correctness
     - Forked version in loom (WASI support)
   * - libgit2
     - 0.19 (via git2)
     - No: tooling only
     - None relevant

Process Mapping
---------------

The automator's pipeline maps to IEC 62304 lifecycle processes:

     - Automator Stage
     - Output
   * - §5.1 Development planning
     - Planner agent
     - Task queue with priorities
   * - §5.2 Requirements analysis
     - Task creation with acceptance criteria
     - ``req`` needs
   * - §5.3 Architectural design
